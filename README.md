# insidejob (scenario)

Megacorp, a very large company, has recently acquired several small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As a risk-averse organization that takes its security posture very seriously, Megacorp is conducting a series of parallel security assessments.

Your task is to evaluate the "insider threat" scenario as part of a red team exercise. You are to identify and exploit any security issues you discover. The goal is to progress from a low-privileged domain user to demonstrating control over the Active Directory environment while uncovering as many exploitation paths as possible.
